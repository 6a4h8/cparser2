Regex is better for writing parsers. Prove me wrong. Working with default perl.

To parse:

`perl ./regexes/parse.pl ./tests/test.test.c`

You can also figure out how to compile.

No custom syntax - you can reorganzie the content of the files inside ./regex to your liking. Possibilities are for example to remove semicolons

(since my syntax is not self agnostic).
